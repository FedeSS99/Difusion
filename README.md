# Limited Diffusion By Agregation
This project simulates the formation of common patterns with the concept of limited diffusion by agregation, the simulation is wrriten in Cython and the visualization with Pyqtgraph.

An array is shown as an image that represents the "density" that a non-specific material sample has in a unit cell; every new cell is obtained through a sequential cycle so for the moment there is not a parallelized method.
